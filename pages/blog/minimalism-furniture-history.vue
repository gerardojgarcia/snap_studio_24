    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold  mb-8">Origins and Early Influences</h2>
    <p class="w-3/4 text-xl m-auto">Minimalism in furniture can be traced back to the early 20th century, coinciding with the modernist movement in art and architecture. The Bauhaus school in Germany, founded by Walter Gropius in 1919, played a pivotal role in this regard. </p>
    <p class="w-3/4 text-xl m-auto">Emphasizing functionality and simplicity, Bauhaus designers like Marcel Breuer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe introduced furniture that was stark in its aesthetic yet highly practical. This period saw the emergence of steel, glass, and concrete as favored materials, reflecting the modernist ethos of "form follows function."</p>

        <h3 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8" >Post-War Minimalism and Japanese Influence</h3>
        <p class="w-3/4 text-xl m-auto">The post-World War II era saw a significant evolution of minimalism in furniture design, heavily influenced by Japanese aesthetics. The Japanese traditional concept of 'Ma,' emphasizing negative space and simplicity, resonated with Western designers. Iconic pieces from this era, such as the Eames Lounge Chair and Isamu Noguchiâ€™s coffee table, reflect a blend of minimalism and organic shapes, offering comfort without excessive ornamentation.</p>

      <div class="flex items-start space-x-6">
        <p class=" w-1/2 text-xl ">The late 20th century witnessed a surge in minimalist design, partly as a reaction against the opulence of styles like Art Deco and Mid-Century Modern. Designers like Dieter Rams and Philippe Starck became prominent for their minimalist approach, focusing on sustainability and the principle that less is more. </p>

        <p class=" w-1/2 text-xl ">Rams' "Ten Principles for Good Design" became a manifesto for minimalist designers, advocating for simplicity and longevity in design.</p>
